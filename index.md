## Hello!

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

I'm Margaret Furr, and I'm becoming a data and information scientist. I also have an interest in organizational strategy and applied sensemaking.

I'm currently working as a Data Analyst with EVERFI, an expanding, edtech company, which provides courses that help students to become financially and digitally literate, engage civically, and develop healthy relationships. I have worked as a pro bono strategic alignment consultant for [Homeless Children's Playtime Project](https://www.playtimeproject.org) and [Jubilee Jumpstart](http://www.jubileejumpstart.org) through [Compass](http://compassprobono.org), and I have worked as a Data Ambassador with [DataKind Corps/NY](http://www.datakind.org). I am constantly asking questions about the world, with an interest in the intersection of the humanities and data science.

## Hello!

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

I'm Margaret Furr, and I'm a strategic thinker and intellectually curious problem solver. I have expertise in history and data science. With an interest in technological change, patterns in data, social networks, and international cultures, I'm a curious and versatile professional who loves to draw from multiple disciplines to understand the world and possibilities for the future.

Currently, I'm working as a Data Analyst with EVERFI, an expanding, educational technology company, which provides courses that help students to become financially and digitally literate, engage civically, and develop healthy relationships. I have worked as a pro bono strategic alignment consultant for [Homeless Children's Playtime Project](https://www.playtimeproject.org) and [Jubilee Jumpstart](http://www.jubileejumpstart.org) through [Compass](http://compassprobono.org), and I have worked as a Data Ambassador with [DataKind Corps/NY](http://www.datakind.org). 

During my free time, one can find me running, reading, dancing, preparing for the future, or understanding [the power of improv](http://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=the+power+of+improv&view=detail&mid=D6F586BD43DCC62C7AAED6F586BD43DCC62C7AAE&FORM=VIRE) in the 21st century. A sentence that inspires me from Daniel J. Levitin's book, [The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload](https://www.amazon.com/Organized-Mind-Thinking-Straight-Information/dp/0147516315), is "Where art, technology, or science alone cannot solve problems, the combination of the three is perhaps the most powerful of all."

## DataKind DC and American Red Cross Project - Home Fire Risk Modeling

<img class="picture" src="home-fire-risk-map.jpg">

I worked on a team of 50 volunteers using (1) open data from the American Community Survey and the American Housing Survey, (2) data aggregated and collected by the Enigma smoke-signals project, (3) data from the National Fire Incident Reporting System, and (4) Red Cross home fire preparedness and response data, to help build this tool for identifying high-risk areas in cities and towns across the United States. To date, over 400,000 alarms have already been installed in over 175,000 households. This [tool](http://home-fire-risk.github.io/smoke_alarm_map/) will ensure that the remainder of the organizationâ€™s pledged 2.5M smoke alarms are installed in the communities where they are needed the most.

I specifically worked on the [Homefire per Tract Risk Indicator](https://github.com/home-fire-risk/smoke_alarm_models/blob/master/model_2c_ind_RC_response/code/RC_homefire_per_tract_risk_indicator.R).

## BLOG
Currently, as we are living through a time of [accelerations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up7K5sRqllw), I am observing trends, imagining a better world, and contemplating how the future may be shaped.

### Liberal Arts and Sciences Thinking
The classes in a liberal arts and sciences program run broadly. In a liberal arts and sciences program, one learns to understand and sense culture, read and think critically, dialogue and debate in writing and orally, as well as study phenomena objectively and scientifically. If one commits to a true liberal arts and sciences education, he or she will take courses across multiple disciplines from painting to classics to astronomy to computer science; and with a broad education, especially if students find common themes that run across the disperse disciplines, students learn to connect the dots across disciplinary boundaries, adapt themselves to different people, thinking styles, and situations, and develop a unique value proposition.

Often, politicians, businessmen, and technologists criticize the liberal arts and sciences education model for being unrealistic to the working world. "A liberal arts degree does not prepare people for jobs", critics say; but I argue that a liberal arts and sciences degree prepares people for careers and supports their developing the abilities to think beyond a job or a title.

In the 21st century, with rapid technological and political change as well increasingly speedy information flows, uncertainties exist. Leading management consultants talk about the various pressures on organizations due to change and the uncertainty about how the world will continue to change in the future; the pressures on organizations then put pressure on people within organizations. Everything lives in flux, and in tension. Change is the only constant to the nature of work. And people do not know what the jobs of the future will become.

To shape the world beyond these pressures and deal with the complexity of them, one must be adaptable, be rooted in a strong foundation, and have an opinion. Having a liberal arts and sciences education, where skills attained may be broad and cross-disciplinary, from writing to coding, liberates students to see beyond a highly specialized job and into the fluidity of what a job even can be. The education liberates students to question what is most valuable and to influence what could be valued. The education frees students from the fear of what jobs will exist in ten years because students carry the ability to imagine what jobs can become.

The dean at UVA has introduced a new curriculum that facilitates more interdisciplinary studies. When at UVA, critics might accuse that I was scattered taking courses across the drama, history, english, computer science, media studies, and math departments; but by taking classes across the disciplines, I was able to see trends relating to global and technological change, revolutions, entrepreneurship, mental models, and paradigms, as well as develop skills ranging from writing to coding to speaking to modeling that can only enhance one another. While the liberal arts and sciences form of education does not lead to instant gratification professionally in the short term, I think that the ability to see phenomena from multiple perspectives and quickly be able to shift perspectives will be helpful in the long term. Politicians criticize the liberal arts and sciences form of education, but I think that it's form of education will support freedom continuing to ring and America's values continue to sing long into the 22nd century, if supported, also by what's practical.

### In Honor of Marting Luther King, Jr. Day - On Strategic Thinking
Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered, among many, at the Lincoln Memorial, Washington, DC the following [words](http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm):

"And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. 

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.'

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. 

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. 

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of 'interposition' and 'nullification' -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.

I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; 'and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.'"

The power of a vision, or a dream is strong.

People use the word "strategic thinker", claiming to be one. Through this blog, I want to argue that Martin Luther King's demonstrated the art of strategic thinking through his sharing his dream to the nation. He did not speak as a president; he spoke as an African American in a country still segregated. He was putting himself at risk by speaking to the public. Not all in power shared his vision, but as a leader, he was convicted that the country was rooted in freedom and included all races, so strategically by sharing his dream, he had to support the systemic breakthrough for African Americans. Because of his strategic foresight into how the country needed to be shaped for the improvement of it, he let his voice echo through the valley, the hill, the mountain, the rough places, and the crooked places.

It's up to us to to live his dream, but I believe that we can continue to shape a world where equality is normal. We can lift each other up and embed values of freedom, equality, and inclusiveness into our systems - social, data, and technical. How can we do this? There may be ways to measure social freedom, equality, or inclusiveness in organizations. There may be ways to measure how algorithms affect social freeom or social inclusiveness. There may be ways to systemically break down mental, physical, or technical barriers by becoming more aware of what still blocks complete integration. These are just a few of many - but the dream, I believe, must continue to be dreamt, and lived strategically.

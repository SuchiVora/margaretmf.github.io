## BLOG
Currently, as we are living through a time of [accelerations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up7K5sRqllw), I write about trends I observe, how I imagine a better world,
and how the future may be shaped.

### In Honor of Marting Luther King, Jr. Day - On Strategic Thinking
Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered at the Lincoln Memorial, Washington, DC the following [words](http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm), among many:

"And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. 

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.'

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. 

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. 

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of 'interposition' and 'nullification' -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.

I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; 'and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.'"

The power of a vision, or a dream is strong.

People often throw around the word "strategic thinker", claiming to be one. Through this blog, I want to argue that Martin Luther King's demonstrated the art of strategic thinking through his sharing his dream to the nation. He did not speak as a president; he spoke as an African American in a country still segregated. He was putting himself at risk by speaking to the public. Not all in power shared his vision, but as a leader, he was convicted that the country was rooted in freedom and included all races, so strategically by sharing his dream, he had to support the systemic breakthrough for people of color. Because of his strategic foresight into how the country needed to be shaped for the improvement of it, he let his voice echo through the valley, the hill, the mountain, the rough places, and the crooked places.

It's up to us to continue to live this vision, but I believe that we can continue to shape a world where equality is the norm. We can lift each other up and embed values of freedom, equality, and inclusiveness into our systems - social, data, and technical. How can we do this? There may be ways to measure social freedom, equality, or inclusiveness in organizations. There may be ways to measure how algorithms affect social freeom, social equality, or social inclusiveness. There may be ways to systemically break down mental, physical, or technical barriers to social freedom, equality, or inclusiveness. These are just a few of many - but the dream must continue to be dreamt, and lived.
